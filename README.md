# ML8511
This repo contains the slope line estimation for GY-ML8511 UV sensor for Arduino Uno

Followng is the OUTPUT VALTAGEâ€“ UV INTENSITY CHARCTERISTICS from the LAPIS datasheet (https://cdn.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Sensors/LightImaging/ML8511_3-8-13.pdf)

From the above plot we can estimate the relationship between UV intensity (mW/cm<sup>2</sup>) and output voltage (V) as follows.

We try to estimate m i.e. sole of the straight line from the above plot.

(y<sub>2</sub> - (y<sub>1</sub>) = m ((x<sub>2</sub> - (x<sub>1</sub>)       equation (1)
